[["io.html", "2 Loading spatial layers 2.1 Spatial data", " 2 Loading spatial layers 2.1 Spatial data Spatial data is represented digitally in many different ways. For sake of simplicity, digital spatial models are divided in raster and vector models. Raster models represent the real world basically by overlaying a grid and giving values to the grid nodes that represent, at that location, the value of the variable that we want to represent. Let’s see an example: you want to digitally represent the height above sea level of an area. You can overlay (imagine) a grid over your area and decide that the grid cells are 1 meter by 1 meter in size. You will measure at the cell center (i.e. the node) the height above sea level, probably in meters. You will thus have a matrix, with RxC rows and colums respectively. Raster and vector file types Data are digitally stored in memory with different formats that correspond to files. For a nice over view of existing vector and raster common formats please check the OGR and GDAL drivers’ websites, for vector models and raster models respectively.
